#### Implementing-Custom-RandomSearchCV
- Implementing Custom RandomSearchCV (sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV) from scratch.
- RandomSearchCV Method (also called as K-fold cross validation) is useful for training a Machine learning model without losing data-portion of cross validation or test dataset.
- This repository will help understand step by step working and nitty gritty details of RandomSearchCV (K-Fold CV).
